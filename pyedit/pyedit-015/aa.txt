# This is   open source editor. The motivation for this project was to create a 
# modern    multi-platform editor. Simple, powerful, configurable, extendable.
# It has    macro recording/play, search/replace, functional navigation,
#           comment/string spell check, auto backup, persistent undo/redo, 
# auto      complete, auto correct, ... and a lot more. It is fast.
# It is     extendable, as python lends itself to easy tinkering. The editor
# has a     table driven key mapping. One can easily edit the key map in 
# keyhand.py, and the key actions in acthand.py
# The default key map resembles gedit / wed / etp / brief
# ASCII only fixed font only for now. Requires pygtk.
