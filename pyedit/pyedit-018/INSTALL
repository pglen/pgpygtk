                              INSTALL
                              
   Just type 'make install'. You need to be root to install pyedit.
   
   PyEdit requires gnome libs, GTK, pyGTK and related libreaaries. Most distros
come with them pre-installed, so pyedit should run on most systems.

   To display the keymap and documentation, pyedit needs pangview.py 
     
 If you do not have root access, pyedit will run from any directory, provided
that the subdirectory pyedlib is under the directory pyedit.py  is in.

 You may also install pyedit in the user's private bin directory 
 (if it is in the user's path) with the command cp -a * ~/bin
