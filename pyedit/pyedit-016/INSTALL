                              INSTALL
                              
   Just type 'make install'. You need to be root to install pyedit.
   
   PyEdit requires gnome libs, GTK, pyGTK and related libreaaries. Most distros
come with them pre-installed, so pyedit should run on most systems.

   To display the keymap and documentation, pyedit needs pangoview (included)
