   Welcome to pyedit. The motivation for this project was to create a modern 
multi-platform editor. Simple, powerful, configurable, extendable.

   It has macro recording/play, search/replace, functional navigation, 
comment/string spell check, auto backup, persistent undo/redo, auto complete, 
auto correct, ... and a lot more. 

   It is fast, it is extendable, as python lends itself to easy tinkering. The 
editor has a table driven key mapping. One can easily edit the key map in 
keyhand.py, and the key actions in acthand.py 

  The default key map resembles gedit / wed / etp / brief. ASCII only fixed 
font only for now. Requires pygtk.

  See KEYS file for the list of keyboard shortcuts by pressing F3 in the 
editor or look at the file in pyedlib/KEYS.
