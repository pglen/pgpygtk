                              INSTALL
                              
   Just type 'make install'. You need to be root to install pyedit.
(sudo ./install.py will work just as well)
   
   PyEdit requires gnome libs, GTK, pyGTK and related libraries. Most distros
come with them pre-installed, so pyedit.py should run on most any system including
Linux, Windoze and Macz. One of the motivations, of course is to have the same text
editor on all platforms. (Pyedit is tested on Linux and Windows)

 To display the keymap and documentation, pyedit needs pangview.py (included)
     
  If you do not have root access, pyedit will run from any directory, provided
that the subdirectory pyedlib is under the directory pyedit.py is in.

 You may also install pyedit in the user's private bin directory 
 (if it is in the user's path) with the command like cp -a * ~/bin
