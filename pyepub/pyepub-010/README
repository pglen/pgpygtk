 Welcome to the simplest EBOOK reader PYEPUB. It literally reads the books out 
loud for you.

 The PYEPUB reader was built to fill a gap in the reader landscape, to use text
to speech as a feature of  convenience. It will  interpret the EPUB format, and
optionally can be used as a simple HTML reader.

 PYEPUB is simple. It  attempts to follow standards as  accurately as possible. 
It is meant  to be a text  reader, so the  textual information  of an  EBOOK is 
at focus. To this end, only a small subset of the HTML  language is implemented,
only  tags  relevant  to  displaying  text and navigation are dealt  with. Some
rudimentary imaging support is included,  metaphorically expressed, just enough
support to display Einstein's Relativity formula images.

 PYEPUB can be driven from the command line. Use the -h option to list command
switches available. 

Notable switches are: 

        '-a' to read an EBOOK with TTS; 
        '-f' for starting PYEPUB full screen
        '-k' to show key assignments

 When loading an EPUB file, PYEPUB will attempt to position the cursor to the 
place were you where on previous read. This makes it extremely  convenient to 
use PYEPUB.  

 PYEPUB uses Pygtk for display and Festival for text reader. These packages 
are widely available, and most distributions install them by default. See 
the file FESTIVAL for more info on the TTS subsystem.

 PYEPUB is installed on Community Linux with a rudimentary set of free EBOOK
samples like Einstein's relativity, War and Peace and similar works.
 
 PYEPUB is multi platform, will run everywhere where pygtk runs.
