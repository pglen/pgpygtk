                                  FESTIVAL
                                
 PYEPUB uses Festival for text to speech. (TTS) Festival is a giant project 
in itself, but we are using it as a black-box entity. We drive it through the 
command line interface. For example:

   echo "Hello" | festival --tts
   
 Should say the word 'hello' through your speakers.

 On our test system we used the speaker titled 'voice_kal_diphone'. It sounds 
decent enough to be of  practical value. To  achieve that, just create a file 
named '.festivalrc' in your home  directory and paste the following line into 
it:
 
(set! voice_default 'voice_kal_diphone)

 If you already have a .festivalrc, comment out the older entry like so:

;(set! voice_default 'voice_ked_diphone)

 If you want to restore the default speaker, comment out all the voice_default
entries or delete the .festivalrc file.

 You may find other voices / speakers for festival. As festival is a giant 
project, it is beyond the scope of this document to give further instructions.
