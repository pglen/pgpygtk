                                  ESPEAK
                                
 PYEPUB can use ESPEAK for text to speech. (TTS) ESPEAK is a separate project 
from PYEPUB, we are using it as a black-box entity. We drive it through the 
command line interface. For example:

    espeak -f file_to say
    
Should read said file.

 ESPEAK has many options, some of the useful ones pasted here:
 
    -a <integer>
    	   Amplitude, 0 to 200, default is 100
    -g <integer>
    	   Word gap. Pause between words, units of 10mS at the default speed
    -l <integer>
    	   Line length. If not zero (which is the default), consider
    	   lines less than this length as end-of-clause
    -p <integer>
    	   Pitch adjustment, 0 to 99, default is 50
    -s <integer>
    	   Speed in words per minute, 80 to 390, default is 170
    -v <voice name>
    	   Use voice file of this name from espeak-data/voices
    
 You may change the voise with the option -v. The default installation contains
at least the following:
 
  english, english-us, default, en-scottish ....
