  Welcome to PyAla. This utility imatates the 'at' subsystem in python. The
major difference is that PyAla has an eazy to use graphical user interface.

 The utility works very similar to the 'at' counterpart. The spool filenames
encode the date and time for the alarm, and the spool file itself contains
instructions what to execute. This assures, that the spool python daemon does 
not need to read files, so it consumes very little processiong power.

 The spool file state is encoded in the filename's first letter. 
 
    'a' stands for alarm phase      (Awaiting)
    'b' stands for triggerable      (Batched)
    'c' stands for triggered        (Clocked)
    'd' stands for finished         (Done)
    
 An example spool file name is: d201509151840
 
 Decodes as:
 
            d                   - finished
            2015 / 09 / 15      - date
            18 : 40             - time
    
 PyAla attempt to be informative and gentle. The alarm pops uop a window 
without taking a focus of your current window. It can execute any system 
command. The command line is 

 For example, one can specify a command line 'espeak "Hello World"' will make
the computer say those words at a specified time.
