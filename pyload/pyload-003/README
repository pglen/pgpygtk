  PyLoad is a power saver utility. It displays the processor usage,
and when a processor power is sufficently low for a timeout period, it 
executes a program.

  Pyload will monitor keystrokes, and will put the ssytem to sleep after
a specified timeout.

 PyLoad needs to run in previledged mode. It will back off its 
priviledges before the GUI starts, and only elevate to execute the suspend
operation. When returning from suspend, it will immidiately surrender
the escaled priviledges.

 To run pyload from a script without a pass, add the following line to the
file /etc/sudoers:

ALL     ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/pyload.py

or whatever path you installed pyload.py

 and then run "sudo pyload.py"
 
  PyAlarm is highly configurable, like processor idle treshold, procession idle
timeout, program to execute on idle and keyboard timeout for shutdown.

 Pyload will successfully put systems to sleep that fail under the standard
GUI utilities. Perhaps the kernel method became more robust then the 
alternatives.

 The command line option -t Minutes specifies the sleep timeout in minutes.
Minutes can not be zero.
