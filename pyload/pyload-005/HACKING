                               HACKING

  Pyload install creates a group called 'shutdown'. A user given membership
in this group is allowed to shut down the computer. PyLoad will set the
group and group permission of /sys/power/state.
                           
   However, if this is undesirable, PyLoad can be run in previledged mode. 
It will back off its priviledges before the GUI starts, and only elevate to 
execute the suspend operation and the key monitor operation. When returning
from suspend, it will immidiately surrender the escalated priviledges.

 To run pyload from a script without a pass, add the following line to the
file /etc/sudoers:

ALL     ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/pyload.py

or whatever path you installed pyload.py

 and then run "sudo pyload.py"
