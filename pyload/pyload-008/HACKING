                               HACKING

   PyLoad is run in privileged mode. It will back off its privileges before
the GUI starts, and only elevates it to execute the suspend operation and the 
hardware monitor operation. When returning from suspend, it will immediately 
surrender the escalated privileges.

However, if this is undesirable, you may create a group 'shutdown'. A user 
given membership in this group is allowed to shut down the computer. 
Make sure you set the group membership and group access to /sys/power/state.

  Pyload alternate install creates a group called 'shutdown'. See the 
alt_inst.py for more info.
