  PyLoad is a power saver utility. It displays machine usage, and able
to put the system to sleep. When a processor power is sufficiently low for a 
timeout period, it executes a program.

  Pyload will monitor keyboard activity, mouse acticity, disk activity, network 
activity, and will put the system to sleep after a specified timeout. Finally 
a power saver that does not cut out in the middle of a download or in the middle
of a compile session.
 
  Pyload can be run as an applet. After installation, PyLoad can be added
to the Gnome Panel by right clicking on the Panel, and selecting 'Add to Panel'
From the dialog select 'Pyload' and click on the Add button.
 
  PyLoad is highly configurable.  You may configure idle threshold, 
processor idle timeout, sleep timeout, a program to execute on idle keyboard
timeout. Processor, disk and network activity is considered idle if thraffic 
is less than idle treshold.

 Pyload will successfully put systems to sleep that fail under the standard
GUI utilities. Perhaps the kernel method became more robust then the 
alternatives.

 The command line option '-t <minutes>' specifies the sleep timeout in minutes.
Minutes can be between 1 to 120.

 To install PyLoad, execute 'sudo ./install.py' or 'sudo make install'
 
 
 The PyLoad graph has the following color allocation:
 
    Dark Gray:      CPU 
    Green:          CPU (Low Pass filtered)
    Blue:           Network Activity
    Red:            Disk Activity


 The activities are expressed in seconds relative to maximum used capacity.
This may not be total capacity, as PyLoad adapts to observed capacity. See 
source for details.
