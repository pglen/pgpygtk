                                     README

  This utility was created to quickly display a formatted file. It was 
embarrassing to wait 25 seconds till the browser starts, just to display
a welcome screen.

 The pangview utility is fast, it displays a regular README file in less than a second.

 The format of the file is friendly, like pango, rich text or html. 
(but simpler)The parser was written in python, it is easy to extend.

 A quick intro:

     <i> Italic</i>     for italic text
     <b> Bold </b>      for bold text
     <r> Red </r>       for red text
     <xl>Large</xl>     for large text
     
Line that starts with a double hash is a comment.

## Comment
Text in <hid>hidden</hid> tags are hidden from display.

For a full description of the Syntax see the SYNTAX file.

Note that this text displays nicely both on terminals and on the pangview 
utility,

This project is in the public domain.
