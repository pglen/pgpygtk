                                     README

  This utility was created to quickly display a formatted file. It was 
embarrassing to wait 25 seconds until the browser starts, just to display
a welcome screen or a small file.

 The pangview utility is fast, it displays a regular README file in less 
than a second. However, bear in mind, the graphics engine renders the whole
file, so large files may take a while le to load. Thus pangview 
excels on loading 'readme' size files fast.

 The format of the file is friendly, like pango, rich text or html. 
(but simpler) The parser was written in python, it is easy to extend.

 A quick intro:

     <i> Italic</i>     for italic text
     <b> Bold </b>      for bold text
     <r> Red </r>       for red text
     <xl>Large</xl>     for large text
     
Line that starts with a double hash is a comment.

## Comment
Text in <hid>hidden</hid> tags are hidden from display.

For a full description of the Syntax see the SYNTAX file.

Note that this text displays nicely both on terminals and on the pangview 
utility,

Command line syntax:

    pangview.py [options] filename
    
 There are various options to see the workings of the lexer / parser, 
like dumping the lexer stack or dumping the parser states. 

 The option -c is to display Table Of Contents pane. Links in the TOC pane
may be used to control the main view's contents.

This project is in the public domain.
